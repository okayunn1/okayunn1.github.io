      <p>
        June first, my birthday‚Äîrolled around, which means one thing: relatives handing me cash.
        I already rent a few VPSes for assorted projects, but I‚Äôd been itching for some on-prem horsepower.
      </p>

      <p>
        Scrolling OfferUp (think Facebook Marketplace‚Äôs cousin for those that don't know), I spot:
        <strong>‚ÄúDell OptiPlex 3050 SFF - $50.‚Äù</strong> Fifty bucks? Say less.
      </p>

      <p>
        The listing promised an ‚Äúi5 7th-gen, up to 32 GB DDR4 (config varies).‚Äù I paid the guy in a Home Depot
        parking lot, and drove home with my new ‚Äúserver.‚Äù He mentioned it came
        from a bank and the fleet had just fallen out of warranty. Bank‚Äôs loss, my gain.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the case sticker said <em>i3</em>? Suspicious.
      </p>

      <h2>Pop the lid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>0√ó SSD (expected)</li>
        <li>1√ó 8 GB stick-DDR4-3200 on an ‚Äúold‚Äù box?!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>BIOS time</h2>
      <p>
        I boot into setup and <em>cue Zelda chest-opening SFX</em>, it reports an
        <strong>i3-10100 (10th-gen Comet Lake)</strong>. Wait, what? Turns out I‚Äôd
        accidentally scored an <strong>OptiPlex 3080</strong>. ü§ëü§ëü§ë
      </p>

      <h2>Quick upgrades</h2>
      <p>I threw money at Amazon, grabbed a spare HDD and a screw for the NVMe I had laying around and installed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>32 GB DDR4 (dual-channel RAM)</li>
        <li>512 GB NVMe SSD</li>
        <li>1 TB 7 200 RPM ‚Äúspinning rust‚Äù I rescued from e-waste last year </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The stack</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proxmox VE</strong> because KVM is cool</li>
        <li><strong>OpenWRT VMs</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Router-A: WireGuard to a $2/mo DartNode VPS (CGNAT, begone)</li>
            <li>Router-B: Mullvad for‚Ä¶ reasons</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What‚Äôs next?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Flip the OptiPlex for a quieter enterprise workstation with more drive-bays and allows me to expand on it more</li>
        <li>Proper ZFS mirrors or hardware RAID</li>
        <li>Symmetric fiber the second I move somewhere that has <strong>ACTUAL</strong> internet</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This rig is my first <em>real</em> homelab box. I did have an old gaming laptop + Raspberry Pi 4, but this is much nicer.
        Cloud‚Äôs fine, but nothing beats tinkering with bare-metal you bought for less than a nice dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you‚Äôve ever thought about homelabbing, do it. Even a tiny setup teaches you tons and
        sometimes the marketplace gods hand you a $50 Comet-Lake miracle.
